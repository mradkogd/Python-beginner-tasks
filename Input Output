n children divide k apples equally, the non-divisible remainder remains in the basket. 
How many apples will each child get? How many apples will be left in the basket? 
The program receives the numbers n and k as input and must output the desired number of apples (two numbers).

n = int(input())
k = int(input())
print(k//n)
print(k%n)





Number n is given. N minutes have passed since the beginning of the day. 
Determine how many hours and minutes the digital clock will show at this moment. 
The program should output two numbers: the number of hours (from 0 to 23) and the number of minutes (from 0 to 59). 
Note that the number n can be greater than the number of minutes in a day.

n = int(input())
n = n%(60*24)
print(n//60, n%60)





Write a program that reads an integer and outputs text similar to the one in the example (spaces are important!).

x = int(input())
print("The next number for number " + str(x) + " is " + str(x+1))
print("The previous number for the number " + str(x) + " is " + str(x-1))





Write a program that greets the user by displaying the word Hello, the entered name, and punctuation, as in the following example:

name = str(input())
print ("Hello, " + name + "!")
